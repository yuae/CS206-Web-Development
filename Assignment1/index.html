	<p>
		When the time is not so ruled by science, people still feared the nature. People 
		believe in the shadows hiding the creatures that sometimes help them aometiomes
		hurt them. In Western world, there's moster, ghost, spook, undead, devil, fairy...
		But in China, there is one common word called "Yao Guai".
	</p>
	
	<p>
		According to the definition, "Yao Guai" implies creatures that evoled from the plant 
		or animals, it also implies the weird and unnomal things.
	</p> 
	
	<p>
		In China, there is no book introduced all the unnomal creatures and things like the 
	   book "The Classic of Mountains and Seas", it is believed to be written around the 
	   Qin Dynasty. The contents in the book is so weird that many argues they are just the
	   imaginations of the ancient people. But wether it's true or not the stories it left 
	   us are fascinating.
